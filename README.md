Howdy!

The idea of this website is to allow users to share and provide feedback on recipes (yes, for food!). The website's name is 'Yummy', mostly because I really enjoy food. 

Users will be able to do the following:
- Create a profile
- Profiles created have a password and a name. These are stored in plaintext because I really don't want to deal with hashing.
- Users can 'search' through profiles, and look at all of the posts that a user has made.
- Users can post recipes. Recipes require the following items: Title, Ingredients, Photo URL, Recipe, Commentary.
- Users can also comment on recipes. Yummy!
- Finally, users can downvote or upvote recipes. The front page of the website is based off 'best' recipes. 

If you would like to test some of the accounts, you can use the following:
