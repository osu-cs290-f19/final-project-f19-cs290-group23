Howdy!

The idea of this website is to allow users to share and provide feedback on recipes (yes, for food!). The website's name is 'Yummy Foods', mostly because I really enjoy yummy food. 

Users will be able to do the following:

- Users can post recipes. Recipes require the following items: Title, Ingredients, Photo URL, Recipe, Commentary.
- Users will require a username to post a recipe. 
- Users can filter through the following types of posts:
  - Sort by date
  - Sort by username
  - Sort by title (substrings included!)
  - Sort by 'best' (highest liked posts.)
- Users can also comment on recipes. Yummy!
  - Depending on how much time I have, I may do some more complicated commenting systems.
- Finally, users can like or dislike recipes. The front page of the website is based off sorted recipes. Users can decide the sort.
